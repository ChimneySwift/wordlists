# Word Lists
An extensive compilation of potentially offensive words for use in chat filters

`all.txt` contains a list of 1923 potentially offensive words and word obfuscations.

`curated.txt` contains a curated list of 455 words which would be considered offencive to most people.

Note: It's a good idea to compile a single regex and reuse it to match these words for performance reasons. It's also a good idea to use a loop to generate obfuscations if you want a more aggressive filter.
